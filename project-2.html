              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As an intern at Teva Pharmaceuticals, I designed and implemented automated workflows using Alteryx to replace time-consuming manual finance and tax processes. I worked closely with the Tax Team and other stakeholders to understand their requirements, then independently developed scalable Alteryx solutions that cleaned, transformed, and output structured data from Excel and SAP sources. I worked with a international Alteryx team to deploy the workflows to the Alteryx Server so non-licensed users could run them easily through a web interface. These solutions improved accuracy, saved dozens of hours monthly, and continue to support the department today.
              <hr style="border-top: double 4px black; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: 40px;">
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Problem/Goal</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Certain tasks within the finance department at Teva relied heavily on manual work to extract, clean, and organize data for recurring reporting tasks. This included sorting Excel exports, validating tax data, and preparing T106 tax return files using data from SAP. My goal was to automate these repetitive processes using Alteryx—reducing manual effort, minimizing errors, and improving turnaround time.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">My Role</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                I led the automation process from start to finish. This included meeting with team members to gather requirements, analyzing their current manual steps, designing and building each Alteryx workflow, and ensuring every solution aligned with business needs. I had no prior experience with Alteryx at the start, so I took the initiative to learn the platform independently while working under tight timelines. I was responsible not just for the technical development, but also for the end-user experience and sustainability of each solution after my term.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Planning</strong><br>
                I met with stakeholders across the finance and tax teams to understand their current workflows and challenges. Through these discussions, I gathered the specific logic, formatting rules, and outputs they needed. I also assessed whether each process was worth automating based on its complexity and the time it consumed.
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Development</strong><br>
                Using Alteryx, I built workflows that handled everything from categorizing Excel data to generating fully formatted T106 files from SAP exports. I applied key data analysis principles (cleaning, transforming, and validating inputs) to ensure each output met business needs. As the only team member working with Alteryx regularly, I learned the platform on my own and used documentation to guide more advanced functionality.
              </p>
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Testing</strong><br>
                Each workflow went through multiple rounds of testing with real data. I checked outputs against existing manual results, identified logic issues, and refined the workflows until they were consistent and reliable. I also made sure the workflows could handle edge cases and be reused for future reporting cycles.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Collaboration</strong><br>
                I worked with Teva’s Alteryx Server administrator to deploy the workflows, allowing team members without Alteryx licenses to run them through a secure web interface. I also supported other teams by offering help with additional automation tasks when I had extra capacity, extending the impact of my work beyond the Tax Team.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
                To ensure a smooth transition, I wrote clear and concise documentation for each workflow. This included how to run and update them, input/output requirements, and instructions for making changes in the future.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Since Alteryx wasn’t widely used within the department, I had to take full ownership of learning the platform and proving its value. I solved technical challenges by reading documentation, testing tools on real data, and staying focused on usability and maintainability. Balancing technical work with clear communication was key to building trust and adoption across the team.
              </p>
            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Outcome</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The automations I built saved the department dozens of hours per month by eliminating manual processes and reducing errors. They continue to be used through Alteryx Server, enabling non-licensed users to run workflows via the internal web interface.
