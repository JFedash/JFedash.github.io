              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Pixel Pets is a virtual pet desktop game inspired by the Tamagotchi concept. Developed in Java Swing, the project emphasizes object-oriented programming, waterfall planning, and interactive UI design. Features include sprite animations, real-time pet attributes, and parental controls to promote a fun, educational experience. My contributions spanned interface design, gameplay logic, and team coordination to deliver a polished and responsive product. We received a final grade of over 95% on the project.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Problem/Goal</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The objective was to create a desktop application that simulates the experience of caring for a digital pet. The game needed to be engaging, intuitive, and educational, incorporating features such as animated sprites, sound, real-time behavior changes, and restrictions for parental control.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">My Role</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                I was responsible for building the user interface, implementing core gameplay mechanics, and integrating visual elements. I also contributed heavily to planning documentation, team coordination, and ensuring system stability.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Planning</strong><br>
                We followed the waterfall model, starting with detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements. I contributed to creating UML diagrams, mockups, and design specs to guide development.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Development</strong><br>
                Using Java Swing, I built the interactive interface and implemented core game logic. This included sprite animations for the pet, attribute tracking (e.g., hunger, happiness), and parental control features such as timed usage and restricted actions.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Testing</strong><br>
                We conducted iterative system testing to catch bugs and ensure smooth gameplay. I made refinements based on feedback, improving game balance and user experience.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Collaboration</strong><br>
                Weekly team meetings kept us aligned throughout development. I often led coordination efforts, managed version control using GitLab, and maintained shared documentation to track progress and tasks.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We faced challenges with sprite animation synchronization and game state persistence. To solve this, I optimized image asset management, refined the logic that updates pet states in real-time, and implemented the singleton design pattern to maintain consistent data across game sessions.
              </p>
            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Outcome</h3>
            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We successfully delivered a feature-rich desktop game with responsive visuals, interactive gameplay, and a clean UI. The game met all project goals and received a final grade of over 95 percent. It also strengthened my skills in Java development, software planning, and collaborative teamwork.
